	<h1>Travel Captures</h1>
	<h3>Why travel around the world?</h3>
	<p id="descrip">We believe that traveling around the world shouldn’t be hard: it’s actually something everyone should be able to do at least once in their lives. Whether you choose to spend a few years or just a couple months traveling this beautiful planet, it’s important to see what’s out there. It’s up to you to make the dream come true and take the first step. If you’re open and willing, travel will make you an incredibly more well-rounded human being. People you meet while on the road become some of the most valued names on your contact list. They become places on the map to visit later on. These folks give you a glimpse outside your hometown circle of friends, and force you to take in new and refreshing perspectives, and ultimately realize that everyone is the same.All the challenges and opportunities travel lays at your feet help you discover who you are in a way that’s only possible on the road. </p>
